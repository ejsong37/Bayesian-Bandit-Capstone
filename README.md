## About
This repository contains the code used for the Data Science Project 2 (DSC-180B) course from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) during Winter 2022 under Professor Yuhua Zhu. This project attempts to generalize the Bayesian Bandit framework to include point estimation and define the trust worthy of an recommendation system in the Bayesian Bandit setting. This project is currently in development and not finished.
